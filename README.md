# Traffic-SItuation-Prediction
• Python based approach for predicting traffic pattern and reducing congestion by utilizing data analytics,
machine learning and predictive modeling.
• This study investigates traffic situation by leveraging various classifiers like XGB Classifier,RandomForest
Classifier,KNeighbors Classifier,CatBoost Classifier and GradientBoosting Classifier by using ensemble method
(voting and stacking classifiers) we analyze parameters like vehicle counts (Car,Bike,Truck and Bus)
